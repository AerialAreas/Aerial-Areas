<h1>About The Project</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Project Background/Motivation</h2>
<p>Geometry is an important topic in math that kids start learning at around 4th grade. It has important applications to fields like physics, computer science, and engineering later on. Our goal is to teach and reinforce the basic formulas for area, perimeter, and circumference. We wanted to teach these in a way that would make learning them feel seamless and fun, unlike a traditional classroom setting. We hope that someone playing this game will be able to apply their skills and be motivated to become quicker at solving the problems. We also want the player to have opportunities to apply critical thinking and time management skills such as when to buy powerups and upgrades or when to hit the enemies to defeat them the quickest. We added difficulties to allow players newer to these topics to succeed, while challenging the players that have mastered the topics.</p>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The game is centered around the player defending Earth from the Geometroid invasion, by solving different kinds of geometry problems to defeat enemies. The player must defeat 12 increasingly difficult waves of foes, with waves following a pattern of 2 waves of a specific shape followed by a boss on the third wave, in the order of rectangles, triangles and finally circles. The final three waves use all three shapes at once. Bosses are made up of several of their wave's shapes, and must have all of their parts' problems be solved and added up in the final “boss problem” to defeat them. The problems will either ask for a perimeter or an area of a shape, with the problem and pertinent information being displayed on the left in a list and highlighted, and the falling enemy will also be highlighted. Upon correctly solving the problem, the enemy will explode, and if any nearby enemies are hit by the explosion they will also be destroyed. If the answer is incorrect, the player is unable to answer again for a short time. The player will be awarded points and gold for defeating enemies, and can spend their gold at a shop which is accessed after every wave except for wave 12. The shop will contain helpful upgrades and temporary power ups for the player to purchase. Tutorials will be present throughout the game, showing up when relevant and also being accessible in the menus whenever the player wishes to review them. Formulas will also be present there to aid the player. Upon either running out of lives from too many enemies getting past, or clearing wave 12, the game will end and the player's final score will be shown and they will be brought back to the main menu.</p>

<h2>Original Project Description</h2>
<p>
    As video games become increasingly more common, teachers and parents are increasingly using them to supplement their 
    children's educations in a fun way. Educational games may improve student engagement and incentivize learning. In the past, 
    games such as the Oregon Trail, Number Munchers, SimCity, the Dr. Brain series, and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing have all 
    been used to either teach or reinforce ideas.
</p>
<p>
    This project is for an assignment in the Software Engineering I course in the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The goal is 
    to design and prototype a new educational video game. This game must be suitable for students between 4th to 8th grade 
    (late elementary school or middle school).You may choose to narrow the target age range. The target demographic will likely 
    have an effect on the text, concepts, and mechanics that you want to use; Young children may not have the reading, motor, 
    or analytical skills required for some designs.
</p>
<p>
    The game must have an educational component. The Massachusetts Department of Education and Common Core standards can give 
    some suggestions for topics that are appropriate for different age levels.
</p>
<p>
    This project is open-ended. You have freedom to choose the language, engine, genre, and topic for your game.
